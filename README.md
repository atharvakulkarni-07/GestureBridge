# GestureBridge

## Overview 🌟

The **American Sign Language (ASL) Detector** is a machine learning project designed to recognize and interpret American Sign Language gestures using computer vision techniques. This project leverages deep learning models to process and identify hand signs.

## Features 🚀

- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects ASL signs by giving the image input. 📷
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for improved accuracy in sign detection. 🎯
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for users to interact with the system. 🖥️
- **Multi-Sign Support**: Capable of recognizing multiple ASL signs and phrases. ✋

## Technologies Used ⚙️

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the application. 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training deep learning models. 📊
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training data and model performance. 📈
- **Streamlit**: For clean UI 🖥️ 

## Installation 🛠️

To set up the ASL Detector on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atharvakulkarni-07/GestureBridge.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the ASL detection application:
   ```bash
   python main.ipynb
   ```

## Usage 👩‍🏫

1. Launch the application.
2. Insert the image in the insertion box. 🎥
3. The system will display the recognized sign. 🌐
